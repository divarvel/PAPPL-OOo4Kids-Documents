Project overview
================================================================================
OpenOffice.org For Kids is a lightweight version of OpenOffice.org
specifically designed for an educational use.

Students of Centrale Nantes have already contributed to OOo4Kids in the past,
namely on the annotation feature in Impress, in order to enhance the
integration with Tablet PCs.

Annotation feature
================================================================================

Source code cleanup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some source files are not cleanly organized and formatted. While developping
the features, we will clean those files.

Drawing modes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When enabling the annotation feature, the user is in the "cursor" mode, and
then can switch to the "pencil" mode or the "eraser" mode. When in "pencil" or
"eraser" mode, it is tedious to go back to the cursor mode. A first task would
be to allow the user to go back to the "cursor" mode.

   A better mode switching

We will have to add a new menu entry ("cursor"), in order to allow the user to
easily go back to the cursor mode. This will require us to change the
underlying stucture of some files.

Eraser
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When in the eraser mode, the tool only masks parts of the previously drawn
shapes. It does not actually delete the erased parts. Additionally, nothing is
saved. As for now, it only works in a graphical fashion. 

Erased parts should be really erased and not displayed again.
